# Aim
This is my personnal extensions of the c++98 stdlib.
It is usable for epitech 2sd year projects.
The C++11 brings improvements to c++, like the native conversion between strings / integers, ...

# Content
- accessors : to create 'set_attr' and 'get_attr' methods to access in read/write to an attribute
- Raise : an improvement to standard exception.
- PThread encapsulation (c++11 does)
- std_improve : others (c++ does some)

# Installation
``make install`` with the root rights to install the lib in `/usr/includes/stdextcpp`. ``make uninstall`` to remove the files.
